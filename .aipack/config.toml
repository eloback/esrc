# This `.aipack/config.toml` file overrides the base `~/.aipack-base/config.toml`.

# Note: Was `default_options` in `<= 0.7.9` (both still supported, but now use 'options')
[options]

# `model` is required (any model supported by the Rust genai crate)
#         By default, it is set in the `~/.aipack-base/config.toml`, but it can be overridden here,
#         as with any other properties.
#
# Support models from: OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Ollama (local), DeepSeek, Groq, Grok(xAI)
#
# e.g.,  
#    Ollama: "phi4:14b", "gemma3:4b", "gemma3:27b", "deepseek-r1:70b", "llama4:scout" (or any locally installed Ollama)
# Anthropic: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "claude-3-5-haiku-latest"
#    OpenAI: "gpt-4.1, "gpt-4.1-mini", "gpt-4.1-nano", "o4-mini", "o4-mini-high", "o4-mini-low"
#    Gemini: "gemini-2.5-pro", "gemini-2.5-flash", "gemini-2.5-flash-zero", "gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17"

# model = "gpt-4.1-mini" # or an alias from below (e.g., "flash-prev", "gpro-prev")

# Temperature - by default unset

# temperature = 0.0

# Concurrency - How many inputs can be processed at the same time
# (Set to 2 in the default ~/.aipack-base/config.toml if absent)

# input_concurrency = 6

# Model Aliases - or override model aliases
# The ones below are already configured in the ~/.aipack-base/config.toml
# However, you can add new aliases or override them below (in this workspace config.toml). 
#
# [options.model_aliases]
# # -- Anthropic
# claude      = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
