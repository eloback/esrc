fix the documentation and exports of the crate, some parts like the query are new and not well documented.

>   Note: write_mode is true, so content below this line will **NOT** be included in next run/prompt.

I'll review the documentation and exports across the crate, focusing on the query-related parts that are new and under-documented, as well as ensuring the module-level docs and `lib.rs` exports are consistent.
