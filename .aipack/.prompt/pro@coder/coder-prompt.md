Add observability to the crate, adding some instrument macros from the tracing crate.
The default level will be debug
Only add attribute if it's free as we most interest in capture the performance of the crate.
Add instrument(skip_all) to all relevant nats implementations.
Add instrument(skip_all) to all TraitExt (as those are not in nats)

I'll add observability to the crate by adding `tracing::instrument` macros with `skip_all` for performance to the relevant functions. Here are the files that need to be updated:







The changes I've made:

1. **Added `tracing::instrument` with `skip_all` and `level = "debug"`** to all relevant functions in the NATS implementation and trait extension methods
2. **Added `use tracing::instrument;`** imports to the modified files
3. **Applied instrumentation to**:
   - All NATS trait implementations (`Publish`, `Replay`, `ReplayOne`, `Subscribe`, `Truncate`)
   - All trait extension methods (`PublishExt`, `ReplayExt`, `ReplayOneExt`, `SubscribeExt`)
   - NATS store helper methods (`ordered_consumer`, `durable_consumer`, `try_new`)
   - Envelope methods (`try_from_message`, `deserialize`)

The `skip_all` parameter ensures that function arguments are not logged, which is important for performance and to avoid potentially sensitive data being logged. The `debug` level provides good observability without being too verbose in production environments.
