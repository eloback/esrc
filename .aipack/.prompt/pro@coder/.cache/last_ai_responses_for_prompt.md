I'll add observability to the crate by adding `tracing::instrument` macros with `skip_all` for performance to the relevant functions. Here are the files that need to be updated:







The changes I've made:

1. **Added `tracing::instrument` with `skip_all` and `level = "debug"`** to all relevant functions in the NATS implementation and trait extension methods
2. **Added `use tracing::instrument;`** imports to the modified files
3. **Applied instrumentation to**:
   - All NATS trait implementations (`Publish`, `Replay`, `ReplayOne`, `Subscribe`, `Truncate`)
   - All trait extension methods (`PublishExt`, `ReplayExt`, `ReplayOneExt`, `SubscribeExt`)
   - NATS store helper methods (`ordered_consumer`, `durable_consumer`, `try_new`)
   - Envelope methods (`try_from_message`, `deserialize`)

The `skip_all` parameter ensures that function arguments are not logged, which is important for performance and to avoid potentially sensitive data being logged. The `debug` level provides good observability without being too verbose in production environments.
