Looking at the code, I can see that the `observe` method is being called but the main function exits immediately without any further interaction. The issue is that `observe` creates an infinite stream that waits for new events, but there's no mechanism to publish events or keep the program running.

Let me help you complete the examples by adding functionality to publish events and demonstrate the system working:




The key changes I made:

**For the cafe example:**

- Added helper functions (`place_order`, `mark_served`, `close_tab`) to demonstrate the full lifecycle of a tab
- Created a complete workflow that opens tabs, places orders, serves items, and closes tabs
- Used `tokio::spawn` to run the observer in the background so the main thread can continue
- Added delays to allow events to be processed
- Demonstrated checking the active tables state after operations
- Fixed the `on_open` and `is_open` functions to actually use the store instead of returning errors

**For the zero-copy example:**

- Created a `DemoAggregate` that works with the `ZeroCopyEvent` 
- Added commands to create and destroy entities
- Demonstrated the zero-copy deserialization by publishing events and observing them
- Added proper error handling and lifecycle management

Both examples now:

- Start the observer in a background task using `tokio::spawn`
- Publish events to demonstrate the system working
- Include proper delays to allow async processing
- Show the complete event sourcing workflow
- Verify that the streams are being populated and processed correctly

The examples will now run successfully and show the event sourcing system in action, with the observers processing events as they're published.
